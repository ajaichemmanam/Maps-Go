# Maps-Go
An android app based on Google go initiative

Android Go, the lightweight edition of Android made for low-end hardware. If you try to download Maps Go, you'll likely see that all your phones and tablets aren't compatible. 
So an alternative is made by me using the same progressive web app.

As you can see, the PWA can detect your location, give you directions for cars and public transit and walking, search for places, show different layers, share your locations, and more. 
It also supports more than 70 countries. It's like a mini Google Maps that can be very useful if your device can't handle the full-blown Maps running on it.

Supports Android 5.0 (lollipop) and up. Tested on Android 8.1.0 (Oreo). Download and install apk from Releases folder.
